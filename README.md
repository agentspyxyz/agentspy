## 📷 Example Workflow

Imagine receiving the following AgentSpy alert:

> 🚨 **Behavioral Convergence Detected**  
> 5 high-profit wallets have purchased `$SOLX` in the last 10 minutes.  
> - Market Cap: $5.2M  
> - 24h Volume: $1.3M

You are now empowered to investigate and potentially act **before** the majority of the market reacts.

## 🏗️ Installation and Setup

### Backend (AWS Lambda Functions)

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   `bash
   cd backend`

2. Install Python dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Deploy backend using Serverless Framework:
`cd ../infrastructure
sls deploy`

Note: Ensure you have the AWS CLI configured and Serverless Framework installed:
`npm install -g serverless
aws configure`

### **Frontend (React.js Application)**
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
`cd frontend`

2. Install Node.js dependencies:
`npm install`

3. Start the development server:
`npm start`

Visit `http://localhost:3000/` to access the dashboard.

⚙️ Environment Configuration
Before deployment, ensure the following environment variables are configured:

Variable | Purpose
`RPC_ENDPOINT | Solana RPC node endpoint
MINIMUM_MARKET_CAP | Minimum token market cap to track
WALLET_TRACKING_LIMIT | Number of top wallets to monitor`

Environment variables can be set through Serverless serverless.yml or AWS Lambda environment settings.
